# NeuralNetwork
<ann.py>
Built a neural network for deep learning from scratch without using any machine learning libraries. Introducing gradient desent, forward/backward propagation. 

<model.py>
A binary classification instance to use the library. Also include a comparasion of prediction accurarcy with simple deep learning model in tensorflow. Result: same # of hidden layers, # of neurons, cost function and activation functions, the model created from ann.py library has the same accuracy as tensorflow model(actually 1% higher sometimes).
